# Data Munging: functions


Let's say we want to geolocate every individual plant in out data. Currently, only the plot is geolocated, the data being contained in `vst_perplotperyear.csv` columns `decimalLatitude` and `decimalLongitude`. The location of each individual is defined in `vst_mappingandtagging.csv` which is detailed in `methods/NEON_vegStructure_userGuide_vA.pdf` but we will briefly describe here. 

### Spatal Sampling Design

At sites with qualifying woody and/or non-herbaceous vegetaton, stem mapping actvites and the collecton of vegetaton structure data take place in up to n=20 randomly selected, spatally-balanced Distributed Plots, te axact number and size of the plot varying according to plot type.

An offset mapping technique is used to determine the within-plot locaton of mapped individuals relative to permanent plot markers (pointIDs) for which high-resoluton GPS data are collected (Figure 3). For additonal details on the sampling design and associated protocol, see  [TOS Protocol and Procedure: Measurement of Vegetation Structure](https://data.neonscience.org/documents/10179/2139401/NEON.DOC.000987vE/313b430e-c0b0-4f78-894d-c0300b47488b?version=1.0).
